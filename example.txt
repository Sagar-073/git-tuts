1.working directory
suppose we have 3 files namely ex,ex1 and index.html
--here we have to send staging area by single files 
if i want to send only ex and index.html 
we use add command to send file in staging area: git add index.html,git add example.txt

2.staging area
--but here we have send whole or batch of file to local
here both file goes to local repository
use commit command to send local repository : git commit -m "here we have to any message"

3.local repository
-- here also same we have send whole or batch of file to remote
we have go github create a repository then they give: git remote add origin https://github.com/Sagar-073/git-tuts.git
we use git branch then we found in which we have. ->git branch,then get master  
use push command to go remote repository:git push -u origin master

4.remote repository
--refresh the existing repository page we get files which we have selected.

5.branches:our code present in main/master branch we can deploy or redeploy(if any update is there)
ex:This real-time example demonstrates how branches in Git allow multiple developers to work on different tasks simultaneously without interfering with each other. Each branch represents a separate line of development, and they can be merged back into the "master" branch when the work is complete and tested.
after work done then go to master branch with PR(pull request) then deploy
-- checkout:jumping btw the branches
-- -b:is to create branch 
ex: git checkout -b "copy1". cmd:git branch, now branch changed to copy1 from master.
after check the status: git status, that will give untracked files that is example2.txt

now we can go staging area by:git add example2.txt
then commit: git commit -m "commiting example2"
then use git push we get:git push --set-upstream origin copy1,after pasting this automatically create folder we see other copy1 branch after refresh

If i want to merge the copy1 branch file to master branch use: in screen visible as campare & pull request press that, then write any comment then press creat pull request, then press merge pull request and again it says confirm merge.

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# git-tuts" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sagar-073/git-tuts.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sagar-073/git-tuts.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
